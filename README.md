# MITx 6.00.2x: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science.


### About This Course

[6.00.2x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-5) will teach you how to use computation to accomplish a variety of goals and provides you with a brief introduction to a variety of topics in computational problem solving . This course is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity. You will spend a considerable amount of time writing programs to implement the concepts covered in the course. For example, you will write a program that will simulate a robot vacuum cleaning a room or will model the population dynamics of viruses replicating and drug treatments in a patient's body.


### Topics covered include:
*   Advanced programming in Python 3
*   Knapsack problem, Graphs and graph optimization
*   Dynamic programming
*   Plotting with the pylab package
*   Random walks
*   Probability, Distributions
*   Monte Carlo simulations
*   Curve fitting
*   Statistical fallacies
